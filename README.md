Student Management System

📌 Overview

This project is a Student Management System built using Python and MySQL. It allows teachers to manage students, courses, and grades, while students can access their information and calculate their SGPA.

🚀 Features Implemented So Far

✅ Database Connectivity

Established a connection to MySQL database (StudentDB).

Used mysql.connector for executing queries.

✅ Teacher Functionalities

-Login system for teachers with bcrypt-based password hashing.

-Teacher Menu with options to:

->Add new students

->View all students

->Add courses

->Enroll students in courses

->Assign grades (In Progress - Method assign_grade just added)

✅ Student Functionalities

Student Menu with options to:

->View personal details (view_student_details method implemented)

->View enrolled courses (view_student_courses method required)

->Calculate SGPA (calculate_sgpa method implemented)

🔧 Features Still Needed

->Implement assign_grade() for assigning grades to students.

->Implement view_student_courses() to display courses a student is enrolled in.

->Improve error handling and validations.

->Create a student login system (currently, students enter their IDs manually).

🛠 Technologies Used

->Python (for backend logic)

->MySQL (database management)

->bcrypt (password hashing)

->getpass (for secure password input)

Database Setup

1. Install MySQL

Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system. You can download it from MySQL Official Website.

2. Run the Project
   
   ->python database_setup.py
   
   ->python student_management_system.py

   
   
📝 Next Steps

->Complete assign_grade() and view_student_courses() methods.

Implement a student authentication system.

Improve user experience with better prompts and validations.

Build a frontend interface (Optional).

🚀 Project is progressing well! Keep improving it with more features.
